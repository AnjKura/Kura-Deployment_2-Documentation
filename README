Deployment #2
Welcome to Deployment 2!! Time to step it up a bit for this
deployment. You will need to follow the steps below to set up a CI/CD
pipeline from start to finish. We will still use Elastic Beanstalk and you
will be in charge of customizing the pipeline!!
Install Jenkins on an EC2 if you haven’t
already:
Activate the Jenkins user on the EC2:
$sudo passwd jenkins
$sudo su - jenkins -s /bin/bash
Create a Jenkins user in your aws account:
● Navigate to IAM in the AWS console. Next click on the
Users option in the Access management.
